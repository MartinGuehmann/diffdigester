Digestion is an method to check fast the identity of an DNA sequence in a plasmid and to distinguish different plasmids.  However, choosing fitting restriction enzymes by hand is not trivial and may lead to errors, potentially costing a lot of time and work. Diffdigester.uni-jena.de (https://diffdigester.uni-jena.de/) is a free online tool to find such restriction enzymes. It uses regular expressions to find recognition sites of restriction enzymes in the DNA sequences provided by the user. This tool compares the sets of restriction sites and reports the enzymes that give the mist distinctve restriction patterns. Thus, diffdigester.uni-jena.de is a fast, reliable, and free-to-use tool to help researchers designing digestion strategies for checking their clones in a cloning effort.
